JULY 2022 
Adding these changes to see how to track changes in cloned repoes and adding them back into github




ISSUES:
added fixed max width to stop horizontal layout for now. fix this make it work.

hard to replicate isuue: can get property substring of null. - something is n't 
being found because it hasn't been updated properly i suspect.
update colspotters (inc remove from gamestate) on drag.on. - dragfromgridhorizontal

-code in place, but not working. todo
drag from grid horizontal leaves black circles on remove.
-use updatecolours - if it fins one that shou;kd be null, it can set to null.



todo: 

highlight tiles in game - flash on hover - this is set up to go. - check out roundyOPathGenerator

update tiles.location on lacing, might help with record checkings
findBox. must be given an x and y, relative to the svg element. - 
... no. there are now two findboxes. one that uses the window and one that's relative to the svg game-grid div

update tile locartion index
remove data from arrays - dragging out of game
havewewon?
flex layout needs to update findBox's parameters > on resize .....

Done
vert drag into position works.
and drag from grid.
addding horizontal - issues all over the place.
drag from grid will clearly be a nightmare also. -  doesn't know when it's off grid

ok, so dragfromgrid - add into the onclick tab handler. should be fine.
Placing. jesus christ. sort this out.
tiles - horizontal ones are square?
updat =e circles can't handle null value or current.r
can't gp here - return to base
return to base if outside of grid.



how can it work for touch?
long press to choose?
tap on top/left to place tile
.










































useful game arrays

boxes/locations




tiles 




solution



consistency:

store colours as red: 1

colours = {
    red: 1,
    green: 0,
    blue:  0

}

in solution, describe the different circle Locations as a colours object

ie: cyan:
{
    red: 0,
    green: 1,
    blue: 1
}

in circleLocations:

{
    {red: 1, tile: "tile_3"},
    {green: 0, tile: null},
    {blue:1, tile: "tile_12"},
}

when removing a tile from the game grid (repositioning)

updateCirclesRecord(){

    find the index's of the circles that the tile was over.
    rmove the rgb data.

}
